
Data -- > WHatever ywe emter our system that is know as Data. It is a collection of raw facts. 
Information  -> Processed data is called information. 
Database  -> Collection of Informarion stored at a particular place is called Database


DATABSE MODULES 

1) FMS (File Management System)
Early 1950's
Data stored in Sequential Manner or continous stream of charecters
Drawback - If User needs to find any value then he needs to start searching from begining of file 
Eg: COBOL


2) HMS (Hierarchial Management System)
Developed by IBM in 1968 when they were developing the project called IMS. This Module was dveloped on an operating system called MSDOS
Advantage - Data was arraged in the hierarchial format. Hence use can find out any value easily without wasting much time
Disadvantage - If you want to add one level in between then user has to reconstruct the entire level again and only one use can use the database at a time.

3) NDBMS (Network Database Managemt System)
Developed by IBM in 1969 while devloping the operating system called MULTICS
Advantage : More than one use can share the database at a time
Drawbacks :
 1) No Security
2) Increases too much redundacy -- (duplicating)
3) Occupies lot of memory and decrease the system performance


4) RDBMS (Relational Database Managemt System)
This Module was developed by german scientist EF could in 1970.
Data is stored in the form of tables. 

Here we can define the relations between the tables.
   1) 1:1 - In this relation , one object/record has the relationship with only one object/record.
      Student -- Student ID
      Customer --  Account Number 
      Customer -- Aadhar/ PAN/ Passport ID

   2) 1:m / m:1 - One Object has relationship with Many other Objects.
        Trainer - Courses
        Student - teacher
         Department - Employees
         State - Districts

   3) m:m  - Many object has relationship with many other objects
       Employee - Salary
       Name - Department 
      Vendors - Objects(Pen , books , register , xyz)
      Students and Subjects


Properties of Database

1) Data should be stored in form of tables. Table can be defined as collection of rows and columns. 
Horizontal lines are called Rows/ tuples and Records
Vertical lines are called as column/ field and attribute.

2)  Intersection of rows and columns is called as cell. 
3) Other name of the table is Object/ Entity.
4) Table should not contain duplicate columns.
5) Database should not contain duplicate objects / table Name.


RDBMS Vs DBMS

DBMS (Database Management System)
1)DBMS stored Data as Files
2) Does not apply any security with regards to data Manipulation
3) Since its a file system , Hence there is no relation between data
4) Eg: XML (Extensible markup language) / files

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) 
1) RDBMS stored Data as Tables
2) Secured
3) Relationship between the tables 
4) Eg : MySQL  /Postgres / Microsoft- SQL Server / Oracle - Oracle / IBM DB2


SQL (NOT DATABASE) 

It is just a language --> Structured Querry Language , It is the processed language which is used to communicate with all the types of databases such as oracle , SQl server , MYSQL.
1972 , this language came into the market.

Featrures of SQL:
1) It is not the case sensitive language. 
2) Semicolon after end of each SQL command.
3) SQL ==  sequel
4) Similar to english language
